<p>For a good many years now, Roblox has been growing as a platform for game players and developers alike. Throughout its rapid growth, the game has also expanded to many platforms... except for the Linux desktop. In order to circumvent this issue, we have created a program which uses a Windows emulator named Wine and some other neat tricks to make it run. The best part about this project? It all runs with a simple click; no need to type commands to install Roblox. All you have to do is download and install it.</p>

<p>While we have put quite a bit of time and effort into this project, we can neither guarantee its stability nor its compatibility with your system. We are <strong>not</strong> affiliated with ROBLOX Corporation, nor are we a sponsor/representative. By using this software, you agree that we are not legally responsible if anything happens to your Roblox account as a result of using it, however unlikely that may be.</p>

<h5>
<a id="system-requirements" class="anchor" href="#system-requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>System Requirements</h5>

<p>To install Roblox, you first need to make sure your system meets some minimum requirements. Currently we support the following systems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Debian 6.0 or greater</li>
<li>Ubuntu 12.04 or greater</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, you <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203312800-Computer-Hardware-Operating-System-Requirements">must meet the ROBLOX System Requirements</a>. Roblox will run under Linux approximately equally to how it would run on Windows; if your PC is slow, Roblox will also be slow.</p>

<p>To run the Roblox Linux Wrapper, you must install Wine to continue. See this page for instructions on installing Wine.</p>

<p>Given that this is volatile software (as in it may break with Roblox updates), it is up to the users to help us keep up and keep it working. If you've encountered an issue, be sure to try the "Reset Roblox to Defaults" option. If that does not work, try uninstalling and reinstalling Roblox. If after running these options you still encounter errors, you can <a href="https://github.com/roblox-linux-wrapper/roblox-linux-wrapper/issues/new">report an issue here</a>. Be sure to read the guidelines before posting an error report!</p>
