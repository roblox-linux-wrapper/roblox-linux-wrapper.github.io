{"name":"Roblox Linux Wrapper","tagline":"","body":"### About\r\n##### What is the Roblox Linux Wrapper?\r\n\r\nFor a good many years now, Roblox has been growing as a platform for game players and developers alike. Throughout its rapid growth, the game has also expanded to many platforms... except for the Linux desktop. In order to circumvent this issue, we have created a program which uses a Windows emulator named Wine and some other neat tricks to make it run. The best part about this project? It all runs with a simple click; no need to type commands to install Roblox. All you have to do is download and install it.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n##### System Requirements\r\nTo install Roblox, you first need to make sure your system meets some minimum requirements. Currently we support the following systems:\r\n\r\n* Debian 6.0 or greater\r\n* Ubuntu 12.04 or greater'\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you [must meet the ROBLOX system requirements](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203312800-Computer-Hardware-Operating-System-Requirements) (for Windows, as they do not officially support Linux). While the Roblox Linux Wrapper may work on other systems, we cannot guarantee compatibility nor stability.\r\n\r\n##### Installing Wine\r\nAdditionally, you must install Wine to continue. See this page for instructions on installing Wine.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
