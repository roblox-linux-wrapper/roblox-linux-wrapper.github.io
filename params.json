{"name":"Roblox Linux Wrapper","tagline":"","body":"### About\r\n####What is the Roblox Linux Wrapper?\r\n\r\nFor a good many years now, Roblox has been growing as a platform for game players and developers alike. Throughout its rapid growth, the game has also expanded to many platforms... except for the Linux desktop. In order to circumvent this issue, we have created a program which uses a Windows emulator named Wine and some other neat tricks to make it run. The best part about this project? It all runs with a simple click; no need to type commands to install Roblox. All you have to do is download and install it.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
